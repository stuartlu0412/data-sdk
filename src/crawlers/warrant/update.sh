#   daily (default) — snapshot, announcements, strike/ratio events. ~3 min.
#   full            — the above plus warrant_basic_info's delisted sweep. The
#                     cursor is exercise_end_date, so it re-queries only the
#                     到期日 year-windows from the cursor's year on (a handful
#                     of requests); the first run on an empty state sweeps
#                     back to 2003 (~30 min).
#
# Why full is still needed: a warrant that listed after the last full sweep
# exists only in the snapshot, and the snapshot only carries live warrants.
# Once it expires it drops out, and without the delisted sweep having recorded
# it, it disappears from the database entirely.
#
# Crawl is incremental (dlt cursors under <cache-dir>/mops_pipeline_state);
# the two curated tables are pure functions of the raw layer and are rebuilt
# whole every run, so there is no build state to keep in sync.
#
# Do NOT delete <cache-dir>/mops_raw/warrant_strike_ratio_* to "start clean":
# MOPS serves only a rolling ~18 months of those reports, so the accumulated
# append-only copy is the only record of anything older.
