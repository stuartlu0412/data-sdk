        revenue, YoY %). Cold start fetches ``annd_s >= min_date``; warm calls
        re-fetch the trailing :data:`EWSALE_REFETCH_DAYS` days and merge,
        deduping on ``(coid, mdate, annd_s)`` keep-last so the freshly fetched
        row wins over the cached one.

        ``mdate`` is part of the dedupe key because one company legitimately
        holds several rows on one ``annd_s``: TEJ emits the current revenue
        month and, on ~1-2% of announcements, a restated prior-year comparison
        base (``mdate`` one year earlier, ``d0001`` only, ``d0002``/``d0003``
        NaN). Keying on ``(coid, annd_s)`` treated the two as duplicates and
        kept whichever the API returned last, destroying the real announcement
        whenever that was the base row.

        ``refetch_since="YYYY-MM-DD"`` overrides the window start for a one-off
        deeper repair; :data:`EWSALE_MIN_DATE` rebuilds the whole table as a
        union-merge (~157k rows, ~31% of the 500k/day TEJ row quota -- not for
        a daily job). Prefer it over deleting ``ewsale.csv``: a delete leaves
        the shared cache absent for concurrent readers, and the legacy-parquet
        branch below would re-seed from a stale ``ewsale.parquet`` rather than
        cold-fetching.

        Cached as ``ewsale.csv`` (dtypes re-imposed on read); a legacy
